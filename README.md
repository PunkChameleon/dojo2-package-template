# Dojo 2 package template [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dojo/dojo2.png)](https://travis-ci.org/dojo/dojo2)

TODO: Update travis-ci info for your package, and the package name

The Dojo 2 core library provides TypeScript & JavaScript authors with a complete set of tools for developing
well-structured, highly maintainable applications.

TODO: Replace with a description of this package

## Who should use Dojo?

Dojo 2 core is the best choice for teams that need a baseline set of robust, battle-tested tools for developing
applications, frameworks, and utilities. Dojo is the oldest actively developed JavaScript library, so is particularly
well suited for groups that are looking for something solid that will continue to exist and be maintained for years to
come.

## How do I use this package?

For Node.js users, `npm install dojo@beta` will install the latest version of Dojo 2 precompiled to CJS format.

Other users will need to download and compile directly from the repository for the time being. Precompiled AMD modules
will be provided in the near future as our release tools are improved.

TODO: Add appropriate usage and instruction guidelines
